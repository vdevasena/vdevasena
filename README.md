I'm a **data-driven professional** with a passion for leveraging data to solve complex challenges. My experience spans customer data analysis, sentiment analysis, and developing predictive models for a variety of applications. Recently, I've been focusing on large language models (LLMs), including BERT and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), exploring their potential to enhance natural language processing tasks and streamline data accessibility.
